* I enjoy spending time outdoors, specifically backpacking, camping, and fishing.
* I love Lord of the Rings and reading novels, mainly classics and dystopian. I also love watching movies, my current favorites are "Meet Joe Black" and "Pride and Prejudice."
* I am interested mainly in embeddded system development, though I have taken a couple classes at Grand Valley that used HDL languages such as VHDL and Verilog for FGPA development and I thoroughly enjoyed them. I am also extremely excited to take the HPC class with Dr. Trefftz next semester.

## Technical Background
I completed my undergraduate studies in computer engineering here at Grand Valley and worked at a small engineering firm called Phase 1 Engineering for three semesters of co-op. There I mainly worked on embedded systems using C and Python, simple circuit and PCB design, and solder-work when debugging/creating electrical systems.
